name: Graduate Research Assistant in Hunan University
period: 15.09.2020-15.06.2023
summary: Designed a serendipity-driven recommendation system (PSBR) using GCNs for game recommendation using
Python Libraries PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, improving user diversity metrics by 30%.
contributions: ·Collected and linked various open-source Steam and Amazon customer datasets for machine learning training, applying PCA for dimensionality reduction to optimise storage, visualise data and decrease training time.· Applied statistical methods and clustering techniques (K-Means, GMM, Hierarchical Clustering) to analyse
datasets, presenting key insights in graphs for non-technical audiences. · Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining serendipity and diversity in recommendations, achieving superior results in multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., NDCG, recall, and entropy)
technologies: ·Python ·PyTorch ·TensorFlow ·Scikit-learn ·Machine Learning ·Numpy ·Pandas
