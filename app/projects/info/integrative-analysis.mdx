name: Integrative Analysis of Single-Cell Multi-Omics Data
period: 01.06.2024-01.09.2024
summary: Developed a novel Triple Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization (triNMF) method to analyse gene expression (RNA-seq), protein quantification (ADT), and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq).
contributions: ·Implemented non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Normalization, and Scaling for improved data integration across different datasets.·Optimised computational efficiency using accelerated hierarchical alternating least squares (ace-HALS), and analysed using multiple clustering metods, UMAP, and PCA.·Evaluated model performance with Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Mutual Information (MI), and Silhouette Score, achieving a 15% improvement in clustering accuracy over baseline methods.
technologies: ·Python ·matplotlib ·scikit-learn ·Pandas ·Numpy
